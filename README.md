Although a plethora of images and videos have been generated for each construction project, they have been less utilized for a new project due to the lack of management ability. To overcome this problem, we suggested a deep learning approach to classify construction image datasets in accordance with their activity types. We leveraged a classical CNN model, MobileNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet, and compared their predictive performance. We used 1,351 images with 16 labels from a private construction company and web-images. Moreover, we identified influential factors, including the size of datasets and the presence of transfer learning.
